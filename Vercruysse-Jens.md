# Cards against humanity project

**What?**

A cards against humanity game.

**Why?**

We started making one in the first year (prog 1), but we stopped because it turned out to be too difficult. Now that we have seen more stuff I think it is now possible to create it.

**How?**

Make a database with black and white cards and make a button that picks random cards, logging people in is probably to hard so just having a form where you choose a name will have to do. First to 3 points wins. A gamechat could also be implemented.
